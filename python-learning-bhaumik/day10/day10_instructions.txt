Day 10: Expose Hugging Face Sentiment Model with FastAPI

Objective:
Build a FastAPI API that exposes a Hugging Face sentiment analysis model. The API should accept JSON input, run inference, and return the result as JSON.

Steps:
1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated:
   - On macOS/Linux: `source ai-env/bin/activate`
   - On Windows: `ai-env\Scripts\activate`

2. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic transformers

3. Review the code in `day10/day10.py`:
   - Loads the Hugging Face sentiment analysis pipeline at startup.
   - Defines a POST endpoint `/analyze` that accepts JSON `{ "text": "..." }`.
   - Returns the sentiment label and score as JSON.

4. Run the FastAPI server:
   uvicorn day10.day10:app --reload
   - The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

5. Test the API:
   - Example with curl:
     curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "I love learning Python!"}'
   - Or use Postman or the interactive docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

Learning Points:
- You can easily expose any Hugging Face model as an API with FastAPI.
- The pipeline is loaded once for efficiency.
- FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI docs for easy testing.
