2. Review the code in `day12/day12_imdb_sentiment.py`:
   - Loads the IMDB dataset using Hugging Face's `datasets` library.
   - Selects 5 random reviews from the training set.
   - Loads the sentiment analysis pipeline from Hugging Face.
   - Analyzes each review and prints the predicted sentiment and score.

Learning Points:
