Day 13: Custom FastAPI Project & Review

Objective:
Apply your Python, FastAPI, and Hugging Face skills to build, test, and document a custom API or data science project. Review concepts from previous days and ensure your code is well-documented for learning and sharing.

Steps:
1. Choose a project or API to build (e.g., sentiment analysis, data summarization, etc.).
2. Structure your code with clear comments explaining each step and its purpose.
3. Test your API or script to ensure it works as expected.
4. Document your code and workflow for future reference or sharing.

Learning Points:
- Good documentation and comments make your code easier to understand and maintain.
- Reviewing and applying concepts from previous days helps reinforce your learning.
- Custom projects allow you to experiment and showcase your skills.

Try extending your project with new features, endpoints, or models to deepen your understanding!
