Day 2: Python Core - Data Structures

Objective:
Learn about Python's core data structures (strings, lists, tuples, sets, dicts), list comprehensions, lambda functions, and iteration patterns. Practice by reading a CSV file and filtering data using a list comprehension.

Steps:

1. Prepare a CSV file:
   - Create `students.csv` in the `day2` folder with columns: name, age.
   - Example content:
     name,age
     Alice,17
     Bob,19
     Charlie,20
     Diana,16
     Eve,22

2. Read the CSV file in Python:
   - Use the built-in `csv` module to read rows as dictionaries.
   - Store each student as a dictionary in a list.

3. Use a list comprehension to filter students:
   - Extract names of students older than 18 in a single line.
   - Example: `[student['name'] for student in students if student['age'] > 18]`

4. Print the result:
   - Output the names of students older than 18.

Understanding:
- **Lists** store ordered data; **dicts** store key-value pairs.
- **List comprehensions** provide a concise way to filter and transform lists.
- **csv.DictReader** makes it easy to work with CSV data as dictionaries.

You can run the script with:
```
python day2/students_over_18.py
```

This will print the names of students older than 18, demonstrating data reading, filtering, and iteration in Python.
