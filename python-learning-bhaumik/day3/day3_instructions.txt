Day 3: Working with APIs and Dynamic Data

Objective:
Learn how to fetch weather data for any location using an API, process JSON data, and make your code dynamic for user input.

Steps:
1. Understand the Open-Meteo API:
   - The API provides weather data for any latitude and longitude.
   - Example endpoint: https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=LAT&longitude=LON&current=temperature_2m,relative_humidity_2m

2. Make your code dynamic:
   - Allow the user to input a city name or coordinates.
   - Use a geocoding API (like Open-Meteo's geocoding or Nominatim) to convert city names to latitude and longitude.
   - Fetch and display temperature and humidity for the chosen location.

3. Save and read JSON data:
   - Store the API response in a JSON file.
   - Read the file and extract temperature and humidity.

4. Handle errors gracefully:
   - Check for network, API, or data errors and inform the user.

Understanding:
- APIs allow you to access real-time data from the internet.
- JSON is a common format for data exchange in web APIs.
- Making your code dynamic and user-driven is a key programming skill.

Run the script and enter any city to get its current temperature and humidity!
