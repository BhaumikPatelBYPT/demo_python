Day 8: Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face Transformers

Steps to complete this task:

1. Install the required library:
   pip install transformers

2. Understand the code:
   - The script uses Hugging Face's `pipeline` to load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
   - It analyzes a list of custom sentences and prints out the sentiment (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE) and confidence score.

3. Run the script:
   python day8_sentiment.py

4. Observe the output:
   - For each sentence, you'll see the sentiment label and how confident the model is.

Learning Points:
- Hugging Face's `pipeline` makes it easy to use powerful NLP models with just a few lines of code.
- Sentiment analysis is a common NLP task to determine if text expresses positive or negative feelings.
- You can try your own sentences by editing the `sentences` list in the script.

Extra:
- Explore other pipelines like `summarization` or `translation` by changing the pipeline type.
