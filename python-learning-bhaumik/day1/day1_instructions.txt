Day 1: Python Setup & Environment - Instructions

Objective:
Set up a Python development environment, create a virtual environment, install essential libraries, and verify the setup by printing the Python version and listing installed packages.

Steps:

1. Install Python 3.11 or higher:
   - Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Verify installation: `python3 --version`

2. Create a project folder and navigate into it:
   - Example: `mkdir python-learning && cd python-learning`

3. Create a virtual environment named `ai-env`:
   - Command: `python3 -m venv ai-env`
   - Activate (macOS/Linux): `source ai-env/bin/activate`
   - Activate (Windows): `ai-env\Scripts\activate`

4. Install required libraries:
   - Command: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas`

5. Create and run the script to verify setup:
   - Save the provided `python_env_info.py` script in the `day1` folder.
   - Run: `python python_env_info.py`
   - This will print your Python version and list all installed packages in your environment.

Understanding:
- Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts.
- `pip` is used to install and manage Python packages.
- The script uses `platform` and `pkg_resources` to display environment details.

You are now ready to start Python development with a clean, isolated environment!
