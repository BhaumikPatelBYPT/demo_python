Day 9: Summarization with Hugging Face Transformers

This script demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to summarize a Wikipedia article using the "facebook/bart-large-cnn" model.

Steps:
1. Load the summarization pipeline with the specified model.
2. Fetch a Wikipedia article using the Wikipedia REST API.
3. Summarize the article in 2 sentences.
4. Print the original and summarized text.

You can change the topic by editing the Wikipedia API URL.
