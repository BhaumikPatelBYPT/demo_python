Day 9: Summarization with Hugging Face Transformers

Objective:
Learn to use Hugging Face's `transformers` library to summarize a Wikipedia article using a pre-trained model from the model hub.

Steps:
1. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
   pip install transformers requests

2. Review the code in `day9/day9.py`:
   - Loads the summarization pipeline with the "facebook/bart-large-cnn" model.
   - Fetches a Wikipedia article using the Wikipedia REST API.
   - Summarizes the article in 2 sentences.
   - Prints both the original and summarized text.

3. Run the script:
   python day9/day9.py

4. Change the topic (optional):
   - Edit the Wikipedia API URL in the script, e.g.:
     https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Artificial_intelligence

Learning Points:
- Hugging Face pipelines make it easy to use state-of-the-art NLP models.
- You can load any model from the Hugging Face model hub by specifying its name.
- Wikipedia's REST API provides a simple way to fetch article summaries for NLP tasks.

Try summarizing different articles and experiment with the summarizer's parameters!
